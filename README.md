Introduction
============

This is a repo that contains all of the programming files and Notebooks that we
use during the lectures.

There is no expectation that these 'just work'. In fact in many cases they will not
as they may rely on data that is unique to me (such as passwords, tokens, etc). They
are provided for you to learn from via study and modification.
