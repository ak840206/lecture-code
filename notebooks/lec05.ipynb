It has drawn tremendous attention from both academia and industry and is making deep inroads in industry, government, health and journalism&mdash;just ask <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-fivethirtyeight-gave-trump-a-better-chance-than-almost-anyone-else/\">Nate Silver</a>!</p>\\n                \\n                <p>This course focuses on (i) data management systems, (i) exploratory and statistical data analysis, (ii) data and information visualization, and (iv) the presentation and communication of analysis results. It will be centered around case studies drawing extensively from applications, and will yield a publicly-available final project that will strengthen course participants\\' data science portfolios.</p>\\n                \\n                <p>This course will consist primarily of sets of self-contained lectures and assignments that leverage real-world data science platforms when needed; as such, there is no assigned textbook.  Each lecture will come with links to required reading, which should be done before that lecture, and (when appropriate) a list of links to other resources on the web.</p>\\n\\n                <p>There will be a weekly quiz on ELMS relating to the material from that week. Of these weekly quizzes (about 7), you must take 5. The lowest 2 will be dropped. Because only 5 are required, there is no need to worry if you miss a quiz! Just make sure that you take at least 5 of them over the whole term. If you take more than 5 of the quizzes, we will only count the 5 best scores.</p>\\n\\n                <h3>Requirements</h3>\\n                <p>\\n                Students enrolled in the course should be comfortable with programming (for those at UMD, having passed CMSC216 will be good enough!) and be reasonably mathematically mature.  The course itself will make heavy use of the <a href=\"https://www.python.org/\">Python</a> scripting language by way of <a href=\"https://jupyter.org/\">Jupyter</a> Notebooks, leaning on the <a href=\"http://conda.pydata.org/docs/\">Anaconda</a> package manager; we\\'ll give some Python-for-data-science primer lectures early on, so don\\'t worry if you haven\\'t used Python before.  Later lectures will delve into statistics and machine learning and may make use of basic calculus and basic linear algebra; light mathematical maturity is preferred at roughly the level of a junior CS student.\\n                </p>\\n                \\n                <p>\\n                There will be one written, take-home (obviously, given COVID-19 and all) midterm examination.  There will <em>not</em> be a final examination; rather, in the interest of building students\\' public portfolios, and in the spirit of &quot;learning by doing&quot;, students will create a self-contained <strong>online tutorial to be posted publicly</strong>.  This tutorial can be created individually or in a small group.  As described <a href=\"files/su2021-final-rubric.pdf\">here</a> (<em>subject to change!</em>), the tutorial will be a publicly-accessible website that provides an end-to-end walkthrough of identifying and scraping a specific data source, performing some exploratory analysis, and providing some sort of managerial or operational insight from that data.\\n                </p>\\n                \\n                <p>\\n                Final grades will be calculated as:\\n                <ul>\\n                    <li>10% weekly quizzes</li>\\n                    <li>25% midterm</li>\\n                    <li>40% mini-project assignments</li>\\n                    <li>25% final tutorial to be posted publicly online (<a href=\"files/su2021-final-rubric.pdf\">instructions</a>, <em>subject to change!</em>)</li>\\n                    <!--<li>5% course, Piazza, and office hours participation (extra credit!)</li>-->\\n                </ul>\\n                </p>\\n                \\n                <!-- <p>\\n                You can earn full credit for class participation in three ways:\\n                <ol>\\n                <li>Lecture participation, asking questions and answering your peers questions;</li>\\n                <li>Piazza participation, asking and answering questions on Piazza; and</li>\\n                <li>Regular attendance at office hours.</li>\\n                </ol>\\n                To earn full credit you should aim to ask or answer a question at least once every two weeks in lecture or on Piazza; or attend office hours at least once a month (this can include just going to my office hours to chat about computer science, data, science, software engineering, etc.).\\n                </p> -->\\n                \\n                <p><em>This course is aimed at junior- and senior-level Computer Science majors, but should be accessible to any student of life with some degree of mathematical and statistical maturity, reasonable experience with programming, and an interest in the topic area.

This documentation must verify dates of treatment and indicate the timeframe that the student was unable to meet academic responsibilities. In addition, it must contain the name and phone number of the medical service provider to be used if verification is needed. No diagnostic information will ever be requested. Note that simply being seen by a health care professional does not constitute an excused absence; it must be clear that you were unable to perform your academic duties.</p>\\n                \\n                <p>It is the University’s policy to provide accommodations for students with religious observances conflicting with exams, but it is the your responsibility to inform the instructor in advance of intended religious observances.

Projects will be assigned with sufficient time to be completed by students who have a reasonable understanding of the necessary material and begin promptly.

The implementations in this book are not meant to be high-performance, or industrial strength, but illustrative.\\n                  <li> <a href=\"https://www.scrapingbee.com/blog/web-scraping-101-with-python/#3-requests--beautifulsoup\">Web Scraping 101</a> is a good overview to how web scraping works.\\n                  <li> Previous iterations of this course can be found for the <a href=2019/index.html>Fall 2019</a> and <a href=2020/index.html>Fall 2020</a> semesters.\\n                </ul>\\n            </div>\\n            \\n            <hr class=\"featurette-divider\">\\n            \\n            <div class=\"row marketing\" id=\"bottom-logo\">\\n                <img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"img/umd_cs_logo.png\" alt=\"University of Maryland Department of Computer Science\" />\\n            </div>\\n            \\n            <footer class=\"footer\">\\n                <p>Previous versions of this course:\\n                <a href=\"2019/index.html\">Fall 2019</a>,\\n                <a href=\"http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2018/cmsc320/\">Fall 2018</a>,\\n                <a href=\"https://umd.instructure.com/courses/1227895\">Fall 2017</a>,\\n                <a href=\"http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/spring2017/cmsc320/\">Spring 2017</a>\\n                </p>\\n                <p><a href=\"http://jpdickerson.com\">&copy; 2017&ndash;2020 Dickerson</a> &mdash; <a href=\"https://www.umd.edu/web-accessibility\" title=\"UMD Web Accessibility\">Web Accessibility</a></p>\\n            </footer>\\n            \\n        </div> <!-- /container -->\\n        \\n        \\n        <!-- IE10 viewport hack for Surface/desktop Windows 8 bug -->\\n        <script src=\"js/ie10-viewport-bug-workaround.js\"></script>\\n        \\n    </body>\\n</html>\\n'"

It has drawn tremendous attention from both academia and industry and is making deep inroads in industry, government, health and journalism—just ask\\n      <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-fivethirtyeight-gave-trump-a-better-chance-than-almost-anyone-else/\">\\n       Nate Silver\\n      </a>\\n      !\\n     </p>\\n     <p>\\n      This course focuses on (i) data management systems, (i) exploratory and statistical data analysis, (ii) data and information visualization, and (iv) the presentation and communication of analysis results. It will be centered around case studies drawing extensively from applications, and will yield a publicly-available final project that will strengthen course participants\\' data science portfolios.\\n     </p>\\n     <p>\\n      This course will consist primarily of sets of self-contained lectures and assignments that leverage real-world data science platforms when needed; as such, there is no assigned textbook.  Each lecture will come with links to required reading, which should be done before that lecture, and (when appropriate) a list of links to other resources on the web.\\n     </p>\\n     <p>\\n      There will be a weekly quiz on ELMS relating to the material from that week. Of these weekly quizzes (about 7), you must take 5. The lowest 2 will be dropped. Because only 5 are required, there is no need to worry if you miss a quiz! Just make sure that you take at least 5 of them over the whole term. If you take more than 5 of the quizzes, we will only count the 5 best scores.\\n     </p>\\n     <h3>\\n      Requirements\\n     </h3>\\n     <p>\\n      Students enrolled in the course should be comfortable with programming (for those at UMD, having passed CMSC216 will be good enough!) and be reasonably mathematically mature.  The course itself will make heavy use of the\\n      <a href=\"https://www.python.org/\">\\n       Python\\n      </a>\\n      scripting language by way of\\n      <a href=\"https://jupyter.org/\">\\n       Jupyter\\n      </a>\\n      Notebooks, leaning on the\\n      <a href=\"http://conda.pydata.org/docs/\">\\n       Anaconda\\n      </a>\\n      package manager; we\\'ll give some Python-for-data-science primer lectures early on, so don\\'t worry if you haven\\'t used Python before.  Later lectures will delve into statistics and machine learning and may make use of basic calculus and basic linear algebra; light mathematical maturity is preferred at roughly the level of a junior CS student.\\n     </p>\\n     <p>\\n      There will be one written, take-home (obviously, given COVID-19 and all) midterm examination.  There will\\n      <em>\\n       not\\n      </em>\\n      be a final examination; rather, in the interest of building students\\' public portfolios, and in the spirit of \"learning by doing\", students will create a self-contained\\n      <strong>\\n       online tutorial to be posted publicly\\n      </strong>\\n      .

For this class, such events are the final project assessment and midterms, which will be due on the dates listed in the schedule above.  The final exam is scheduled according to the University Registrar.\\n     </p>\\n     <p>\\n      For medical absences, you must furnish documentation from the health care professional who treated you. This documentation must verify dates of treatment and indicate the timeframe that the student was unable to meet academic responsibilities. In addition, it must contain the name and phone number of the medical service provider to be used if verification is needed. No diagnostic information will ever be requested. Note that simply being seen by a health care professional does not constitute an excused absence; it must be clear that you were unable to perform your academic duties.\\n     </p>\\n     <p>\\n      It is the University’s policy to provide accommodations for students with religious observances conflicting with exams, but it is the your responsibility to inform the instructor in advance of intended religious observances. If you have a conflict with a planned exam, you must inform the instructor prior to the end of the first two weeks of the class.\\n     </p>\\n     <p>\\n      The policies for excused absences do not apply to project assignments. Projects will be assigned with sufficient time to be completed by students who have a reasonable understanding of the necessary material and begin promptly. In cases of extremely serious documented illness of lengthy duration or other protracted, severe emergency situations, the instructor may consider extensions on project assignments, depending upon the specific circumstances.\\n     </p>\\n     <p>\\n      Besides the policies in this syllabus, the University’s policies apply during the semester.

The implementations in this book are not meant to be high-performance, or industrial strength, but illustrative.\\n      </li>\\n      <li>\\n       <a href=\"https://www.scrapingbee.com/blog/web-scraping-101-with-python/#3-requests--beautifulsoup\">\\n        Web Scraping 101\\n       </a>\\n       is a good overview to how web scraping works.\\n      </li>\\n      <li>\\n       Previous iterations of this course can be found for the\\n       <a href=\"2019/index.html\">\\n        Fall 2019\\n       </a>\\n       and\\n       <a href=\"2020/index.html\">\\n        Fall 2020\\n       </a>\\n       semesters.\\n      </li>\\n     </ul>\\n    </div>\\n    <hr class=\"featurette-divider\"/>\\n    <div class=\"row marketing\" id=\"bottom-logo\">\\n     <img alt=\"University of Maryland Department of Computer Science\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"img/umd_cs_logo.png\"/>\\n    </div>\\n    <footer class=\"footer\">\\n     <p>\\n      Previous versions of this course:\\n      <a href=\"2019/index.html\">\\n       Fall 2019\\n      </a>\\n      ,\\n      <a href=\"http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2018/cmsc320/\">\\n       Fall 2018\\n      </a>\\n      ,\\n      <a href=\"https://umd.instructure.com/courses/1227895\">\\n       Fall 2017\\n      </a>\\n      ,\\n      <a href=\"http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/spring2017/cmsc320/\">\\n       Spring 2017\\n      </a>\\n     </p>\\n     <p>\\n      <a href=\"http://jpdickerson.com\">\\n       © 2017–2020 Dickerson\\n      </a>\\n      —\\n      <a href=\"https://www.umd.edu/web-accessibility\" title=\"UMD Web Accessibility\">\\n       Web Accessibility\\n      </a>\\n     </p>\\n    </footer>\\n   </div>\\n   <!-- /container -->\\n   <!-- IE10 viewport hack for Surface/desktop Windows 8 bug -->\\n   <script src=\"js/ie10-viewport-bug-workaround.js\">\\n   </script>\\n  </doctype>\\n </body>\\n</html>'"
